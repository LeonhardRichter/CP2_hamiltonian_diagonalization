  abstract = {Quantum control requires full knowledge of the system many-body Hamiltonian. In many cases this information is not directly available due to restricted access to the system. Here we show how to indirectly estimate all the coupling strengths in a spin chain by measuring one spin at the end of the chain. We also discuss the efficiency of this “quantum inverse problem” and give a numerical example.},

  abstract = {By considering a radiating gas as a single quantum-mechanical system, energy levels corresponding to certain correlations between individual molecules are described. Spontaneous emission of radiation in a transition between two such levels leads to the emission of coherent radiation. The discussion is limited first to a gas of dimension small compared with a wavelength. Spontaneous radiation rates and natural line breadths are calculated. For a gas of large extent the effect of photon recoil momentum on coherence is calculated. The effect of a radiation pulse in exciting "super-radiant" states is discussed. The angular correlation between successive photons spontaneously emitted by a gas initially in thermal equilibrium is calculated.},

  abstract = {This paper has two purposes: 1) to clarify the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation, where the electromagnetic field-expansion coefficients satisfy commutation relations, and the semiclassical theory, where the electromagnetic field is considered as a definite function of time rather than as an operator; and 2) to apply some of the results in a study of amplitude and frequency stability in a molecular beam maser. In 1), it is shown that the semiclassical theory, when extended te take into account both the effect of the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces almost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties as the quantized field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field mode. In particular, the semiclassical theory is shown to lead to a prediction of spontaneous emission, with the same decay rate as given by quantum electrodynamics, described by the Einstein A coefficients. In 2), the semiclassical theory is applied to the molecular beam maser. Equilibrium amplitude and frequency of oscillation are obtained for an arbitrary velocity distribution of focused molecules, generalizing the results obtained previously by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes for a singel-velocity beam, and by Lamb and Helmer for a Maxwellian beam. A somewhat surprising result is obtained; which is that the measurable properties of the maser, such as starting current, effective molecular Q, etc., depend mostly on the slowest 5 to 10 per cent of the molecules. Next we calculate the effect of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, of small systematic perturbations. We obtain a prediction that stability can be improved by adjusting the system so that the molecules emit all their energy h Ω to the field, then reabsorb part of it, before leaving the cavity. In general, the most stable operation is obtained when the molecules are in the process of absorbing energy from the radiation as they leave the cavity, most unstable when they are still emitting energy at that time. Finally, we consider the response of an oscillating maser to randomly time-varying perturbations. Graphs are given showing predicted response to a small superimposed signal of a frequency near the oscillation frequency. The existence of "noise enhancing" and "noise quieting" modes of operation found here is a general property of any oscillating system in which amplitude is limited by nonlinearity.},

  abstract = {The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model has been at the forefront of quantum optics for almost six decades to date, providing one of the simplest yet intricately nonlinear formulations of light-matter interaction in modern physics. Laying most of the emphasis on the omnipresence of the model across a range of disciplines, this monograph brings up the fundamental generality of its formalism, looking at a wide gamut of applications in specific physical systems among several realms, including atomic physics, quantum optics, solid-state physics and quantum information science. When bringing the various pieces together to assemble our narrative, we have primarily targeted researchers in quantum physics and quantum optics. The monograph also comprises an accessible introduction for graduate students engaged with non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions, quantum computing and simulation, and quantum many-body physics. In that framework, we aim to reveal the common ground between physics and applications scattered across literature and different technological advancements. The exposition guides the reader through a vibrant field interlacing quantum optics and condensed-matter physics. All sections are devoted to the strong interconnection between theory and experiment, historically linked to the development of the various modern research directions stemming from JC physics. This is accompanied by a comprehensive list of references to the key publications that have shaped its evolution since the early 1960s. Finally, we have endeavored to keep the presentation of such a multi-sided material as concise as possible, interspersing continuous text with various illustrations alongside an economical use of mathematical expressions.},

  abstract = {Recently the Krylov operator complexity is proposed to evaluate the operator growth in quantum systems, and the variance of its Lanzcos coefficients is used as an important parameter for chaos. In this paper, we generate samples of random initial operators from given probability distribtions (GOE, GUE and the uniform distribution). For the Sinai billiard model, we study the statistical properties of the variance of Lanzcos coefficients in the associated Krylov space. Depending on whether the system is chaotic or not, the resulting distribution of the variance have different behaviors. In the nonchaotic case, the resulting distributions are almost overlapping together. In the chaotic case, they split into two well-separated groups. Besides, all the resulting distributions of the variance are the normal distribution, as long as the matrix size of the initial operator is large enough. This overlap-to-separation behavior, in the resulting distribution of the variance of Lanczos coefficients, may be a characteristics to distinguish chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics.},

Our bounds are intrinsically state-dependent and, in particular, are significantly different in the cases of entangled and non-entangled states; this behaviour also seems to be confirmed by the numerics.},

The algorithm has its foundations in known techniques in solving sparse symmetric eigenproblems, notably the spectral transformation of Ericsson and Ruhe and the block Lanczos algorithm.

The focus of this paper is on identifying those pitfalls and avoiding them, leading to a “bomb-proof” algorithm that can live as a black box eigensolver inside a large applications code. The code that results comprises a robust shift selection strategy and a block Lanczos algorithm that is a novel combination of new techniques and extensions of old techniques.},
